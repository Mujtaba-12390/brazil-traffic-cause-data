## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Mujtaba-12390/brazil-traffic-cause-data.git
```
**2. Install Dependencies:**
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using:
```
pip install jupyter
```
**3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```
jupyter notebook
```
**4. New way to kick-start**
How to kick-start a data science project

Old way ðŸ¥´
- import libraries you'll need
- dealing with import-related errors
- search the correct import statement on Google

(repeat the cycle, depending on the project's complexity)

New way ðŸ¤“
- pip install pyforest

PyForet gives you an unfair advantage to jumpstart any data science projects
With just one line of code, you can import the 40 most commonly used Python libraries
Libraries are loaded on-demand, consuming memory space only when a specific function or method is invoked
This saves you time and ensures that your code doesn't slow down due to unnecessary imports
I can't believe I wasted so much time hunting down imports statements!

**5. Install all Python libraries:**
You must install Python and its libraries. If not, you can install it using:
```
pip install pyforest

```

 **6. Explore the Analysis:** Dive into the analysis by opening the `Brazil Traffic Data Visualization.ipynb` file in your preferred Python environment.
